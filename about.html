                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm Barbara Gilmore, a software developer and web and applications designer based in San Antonio, Texas. I have a passion for creating beautiful and functional web apps that solve real-world problems. I enjoy learning new technologies and tools, and collaborating with other developers and designers.</p>
                <p>Some of the technologies and tools that I use or want to learn are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Node.js</li>
                    <li>React</li>
                    <li>Jest</li>
                    <li>Bootstrap</li>
                    <li>Git</li>
                    <li>GitHub</li>
                    <li>VS Code</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I have always had an interest in what's behind the scenes and the digital blueprint and creation of the internet, as well as applications and video games. I joined the Navy right out of high school and went straight to work as an Avionics Installer and Electrical Engineer for helicopters in the Navy, all while living in Japan. I fulfilled my contract and then went overseas as a contractor for the Army, doing the same. After that contract, I pursued my associate's aviation degrees and completed my programs for both Airframe and Powerplant sciences. I am deciding a big change in my career, not only because I want to do something even more challenging, but because I also want to be a creator and continue to be a role model for my girls; so that they know they can do anything. When I'm not coding, I like to read books, write poetry, watch movies, play video games, and travel to new places.</p>
